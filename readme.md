add modes, like prime mode, prime prioritization mode or rainbow color mode
add log mode, and then remove linear trend (for graph of hailstone path)

I want to add a way to input values, so basically the plotlist=[] accepts whatever you put into a file that it can read
basically you should be able to do something like list(range(a, b)), or [a, b, c] and be registered

for seqlen, make choice to prioritize primes or not, as well as colors

maxgraph should accept a height
