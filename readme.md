# Do you like Hailstones? ðŸ‘€
Well, you're not alone! I also like hailstones, especially during stormchasing, because if you spot that nice green-hued hail core and don't leave immediately, your car windshield will get very nice spiderweb-like decorations ðŸ˜¶.  

On a more serious note, let's talk about a different type of hailstone ðŸ˜„, to wit, the numerical kind! How do numbers relate to hailstones, you may ask? 
Good question. Let's find out!

If you may recall, hailstones form in the upper part of a cumulonimbus, where the temperature is below freezing. The hailstone starts as a raindrop that freezes into a tiny droplet, and slowly grows as it is being tossed around in the updraft of the storm in an up and down motion. And, when it gets too heavy, it falls from the cloud onto your windshield.<br><br>

Now that you've had this refresher, take a look at the following path below.<br><br>
<img src="./readme-images/hailstone!.png" alt="Hailstone Sequence" width="800px" height="auto"><br><br>
Doesn't this resemble the path a hailstone could take while it forms? It sure does! At least, it sort of does!  

Now, you ask, what generated this path? Well, the path is just a connected sequence of numbers... Perhaps, you could call it a *hailstone* sequence, even? ðŸ˜„ Indeed, the generator of this path is none other than the famous Collatz conjecture! 

In this project, I will be exploring exactly that - the Collatz conjecture. For those of you who don't know what this is, let's take a dive into it.  


# The Collatz Conjecture
The *Collatz Conjecture*, also known as the *3n+1* problem, is a famous unsolved mathematical puzzle that has intrigued mathematicians for decades, named after the German mathematician Lothar Collatz, who first proposed it in 1937. The conjecture can be simply summarized as follows:  

1. Start with any positive integer *n*.
2. If *n* is even, divide it by 2 to get *n/2*.
3. If *n* is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to get *3n+1*.
4. Repeat the process indefinitely for the resulting numbers.

The Collatz Conjecture states that regardless of the initial value of *n*, this process will eventually reach *1*. More precisely, the process will eventually reach the cycle *4, 2, 1*, and continue indefinitely.  

Sounds simple right? Well, at its crux, the process the conjecture is based around may very well be simple! But, as math has it, no matter how simple the root process may seem, the whole problem is a completely different story. As it turns out, this is a very hard conjecture to prove. It's so hard, as a matter of fact, that even now as of 2023, nobody has been able to prove it, meaning it's still an open problem in mathematics!  

This isn't from a lack of trying either. Believe me when I tell you that people have brute forced numbers up to 2<sup>68</sup> and still haven't found a counterexample. That's a lot of numbers! Even Terence Tao, one of the most brilliant mathematicians of the 21st century, failed to prove it, though through his investigations, came quite close, being able to show that for "almost" every seed value, its Collatz sequence will eventually reach a value that is less than any well-behaved function that grows to infinity. The "almost" here means that as we take the ratio of seed values whose Collatz sequences don't reach a value that is less than a given well-behaved function that grows to infinity, versus those that do, this ratio approaches 0. Tao has remarked that "this is the closest anyone has come to proving the conjecture without actually proving it".  

Fascinating stuff! 

# The Project
Now that we've had a brief introduction to the Collatz conjecture, let's talk about the project in this repo. The purpose of this project is to allow anyone to explore and analyze the patterns of hailstone sequences visually, which perhaps, in a rare moment of enlightenment, may allow someone to solve it ðŸ‘€. ðŸ¥´ Just kidding, this is probably extremely unlikley lmao. Regardless, the visualization provided by this project should be quite intruiging. Anyhow, let's get started!

## Dependencies
This project is a commandline python project, meaning you should have some form of terminal to run it, as well as python.   
For python libraries, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn are required. You can simply install them by doing

    pip install -r requirements.txt

There is a very very noobishly built docker image for this project, so the requirements shouldn't be a problem. Also, ig I could also try building an executable, but it will be tricky because of the way the project is structured. We shall see, but I probably won't try it. You are welcome to lmao.

## Usage
Currently, the project is run from the source python file, and it is a commandline program. To begin, simply do

    python main.py

There are 5 possible flags, with 3 being optional, along with the help flag.

Hopefully that was clear enough. If not, I will provide some examples below.  

Say we want a regular plot of the maximum height of hailstone sequences for all seed values from 1 to 10000, with log scaling on both axes. We would do

    python main.py -d maxHeight -v reg -l 2 -p "list(range(1, 10001))"

<img src="./readme-images/01.png" width="400px" height="auto"><br><br>
If we want to plot a single hailstone sequence for the seed value 297, with log scaling on the y axis, we would do

    python main.py -d hailstone -v single -l 1 -p "297"

<img src="./readme-images/02.png" width="800px" height="auto"><br><br>
Plotting the same thing as above but with the logarithm plot's linear regression slope subtracted from it is simply done by

    python main.py -d hailstone -v single -l 3 -p "297"

<img src="./readme-images/03.png" width="800px" height="auto"><br><br>
Comparing the hailstone sequences of "27" and "97" with regular scaling and rainbow color can be done with the following command

    python main.py -d hailstone -v rainbow -p "[27, 97]"

<img src="./readme-images/04.png" width="800px" height="auto"><br><br>
If we want to make a rainbow hailstone sequence length histogram with the default plot, which is from 1 to 1000, we would do

    python main.py -d lengthHisto -v rainbow

<img src="./readme-images/05.png" width="800px" height="auto"><br><br>
Say we are interested in how the maximum values of seeds that are primes (we want the prime points to be visible and on top) behave, in particular from 5000 to 10000, with both axes being scaled logarithmically. We would do

    python main.py -d maxHeight -v primeTop -l 2 -p "list(range(5000, 10001))" 

<img src="./readme-images/06.png" width="400px" height="auto"><br><br>
If we want to view the same graph above but with a rainbow coloring, and a max height of 15000 (without log scaling on any axis), we would do

    python main.py -d maxHeight -v rainbow -l 0 -p "list(range(5000, 10001))" -ht 15000

<img src="./readme-images/07.png" width="400px" height="auto"><br><br>
If we want to see how the sequence lengths of seeds from 200 to 1200 behave with normal scaling and primes highlighted but not necessarily on top, we would do 

    python main.py -d sequenceLen -v prime -p "list(range(200, 1201))"

<img src="./readme-images/08.png" width="800px" height="auto"><br><br>

Please note that I did not do any error checking for the flags. If you input an invalid flag or argument for the flag, the program will most likely error out, but in the chance that it works, then ðŸ¥´ bruh. Just follow the above docs properly.  

You can find all the graphs produced by this program in the /generated/ folder from the root of the repo. Which driver/driver version produces which graph is detailed below.

    Driver                              Graph Produced

    hailstone (except single)           /generated/graph.png
    hailstone-single                    /generated/graph-single.png
    lengthHisto                         /generated/pathLen.png
    maxHeight                           /generated/maxgraph.pdf
    sequenceLen                         /generated/seedLen.png

Note that all driver programs except maxHeight will output a .png file. maxHeight will output a .pdf file because the scale of the graph is too large for matplotlib to put into a .png file.

# Closing Remarks
This program is very noobishly written so expect bugs ig. If you find them, please open an issue so I can try to fix it lmao. Regardless, I hope you have fun with this and find some interesting patterns in the data. You're also free to modify the code to your liking to do things like highlight certain types of numbers or whatnot. If you do, feel free to make a pull request to add to it.  

Cheers!
